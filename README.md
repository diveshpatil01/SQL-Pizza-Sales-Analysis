## 🧾 Process Summary
The SQL script creates and populates a pizza sales database, including tables such as pizza_sales with fields like order_id, pizza_name, order_date, quantity, and price. It involves standard SQL operations like CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, and SELECT for data manipulation and analysis. Key SQL functions used include SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), and GROUP BY to calculate KPIs like total revenue, best-selling pizzas, and order trends.

To enable time-based analysis, the order_date column—originally stored as TEXT—was converted to the DATE datatype using the STR_TO_DATE() function in MySQL. This allows accurate filtering, sorting, and grouping by date for insights like daily sales and peak order times.

## 🔍 Project Insights
- Popular Pizzas: Classic and Deluxe pizzas are the most ordered.
- Top Size: Large-sized pizzas sell the most.
- Peak Hours: Most orders happen between 6 PM to 9 PM (dinner time).
- Weekend Boost: Sales are higher on weekends.

    - Focus inventory on top categories and sizes to reduce waste and meet demand.
 
## ✅ Final Conclusion
This project successfully leveraged SQL to analyze pizza sales data and uncover key business insights. By identifying top-selling pizzas, peak order times, and high-performing categories, the analysis provides valuable recommendations for increasing sales and optimizing operations. Implementing targeted promotions, managing inventory based on demand trends, and focusing on customer preferences can help drive growth and improve overall business performance.
